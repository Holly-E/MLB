Create actionable insights for pitchers and coaches using MLB data.

Part 1:
Use pitch speed and movement profile to divide the pitches into clusters using a KMeans Clustering algorithm.
Perform data analysis on the clusters to determined the strike zone with the most likely chance for key outcomes: whiffs, soft contacts and ground balls.

Part 2:
Predict the exit speed of a ball coming off of a bat using a random forest regressor.
Feature-engineering included a finding the True Spin using a 30+ step calculation based on Alan Nathan's work, and included pulling data from two API's (stadium elevation and barometric pressure at the time of the game).
