Use pitch speed and movement profile to divide the pitches into clusters using a KMeans Clustering algorithm.
Perform data analysis on the clusters to determined the strike zone with the most likely chance for key outcomes: whiffs, soft contacts and ground balls.

I also predict the exit speed of a ball coming off of a bat using a random forest regressor.
